# Multiple Imputation for Proteomics (mi4p)

This repository contains the R code for the _mi4p_ methodology (Multiple Imputation for Proteomics), proposed by Marie Chion, Christine Carapito and Frédéric Bertrand. 

The "Functions" folder contains all the functions used for the workflow.  

The "Simulation-1", "Simulation-2" and "Simulation-3" folders contain all the R scripts and data used to conduct simulated experiments and evaluate our methodology. 

The "Arabidopsis_UPS" and "Yeast_UPS" folders contain all the R scripts and data used to challenge our methodology on real proteomics datasets. Raw experimental data were deposited with the ProteomeXchange Consortium via the PRIDE partner repository with the dataset identifiers PXD003841 and PXD027800.
